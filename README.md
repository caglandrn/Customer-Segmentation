# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering  

 **This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.**  
By analyzing customer behavior, businesses can improve marketing strategies and customer retention.

### **Visualizing Customer Segmentation (Raw Markdown)**

### Finding the Optimal K with the Elbow Method  
The optimal number of clusters (`k`) is determined using the **Elbow Method**, which helps minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).  

**Key Insight:** The optimal value of `k` is where the "elbow" or sharp bend occurs.

### Customer Segmentation (2D Scatter Plot)  
After selecting the optimal `k`, we apply **K-Means clustering** and visualize the segments in a **2D scatter plot**.  

**Key Insight:** Customers with similar **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** are grouped into the same cluster.

### 3D Visualization of Customer Segmentation  
For a more detailed view, we visualize the segmentation in **3D**, considering `Age`, `Annual Income`, and `Spending Score`.  

**Key Insight:** Distinct customer groups can be observed based on income levels and spending behaviors.

### Cluster-Wise Mean Values (Heatmap)  
To understand each segmentâ€™s characteristics, we calculate and visualize the **average Age, Income, and Spending Score for each cluster**.  

**Key Insight:**  
- Some groups have high income but **low spending** (conservative customers).  
- Other groups have **low income but high spending** (younger, impulsive buyers).
